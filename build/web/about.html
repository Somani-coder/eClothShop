                            With e-commerce being one of the paramount drivers of the Indian Economy,
                            the market has grown exponentially in the past two decades of the 21st
                            century. The Indian Fashion Industry has been an integral part of our 
                            country's economy even before the tech industry came into existence 
                            and remains one of the major contributors to the growing economy. 
                            The collaboration between the Indian Fashion industry and the E-commerce
                            industry has led us to see growth in both employment opportunities,
                            annual revenue generation, and faster delivery of services and goods.
                            Fast fashion is a very lethal practice that has caused more harm than 
                            good to mankind and the environment in the past decade. Fast fashion 
                            involves the creation of garments in large volumes with cheap materials,
                            low labor costs, and toxic dyes for coloring which are very hazardous to 
                            human health and contaminate fresh water and land. To prevent fast fashion
                            from being a trend, making renting and thrifting of clothes the new normal 
                            is encouraged by the youths and adults of this decade.Eco-Value Wardrobe is
                            the online site to visit for renting or thrifting quality clothes and beautiful 
                            accessories at a reasonable price. If you're interested in putting renting and 
                            thrifting to practice, you can create your account and set up your shop to either 
                            rent or sell your goods and accessories to your customer base. The site includes
                            a queue system for booking appointments, dashboards to check actions taken in the
                            account, and a profile timeline that shows your contact and social media details 
                            which helps you to connect with your clients and audience, and further maintains 
                            a record of your sales with a support system to help out with navigation and other issues 
                            which you will encounter with the navigation. The visitor can make an account and
                            have access to filter products for them based on their preferences like budget, relevance,
                            distance, and types of fashion and accessories. They would be provided with wishlists, 
                            inbox notifications regarding discounts, new arrival, restocks, and availability, and a 
                            query system to help them with navigation and other related issues they encountered with
                            their visits.
